/****Hugging Face Transformers uses the pipeline() function. The pipeline makes it simple to use any model from the Hugging Face Hub for inference on any language, computer vision, speech, or multimodal tasks. The pipeline() automatically loads a default model and a pre-processing class capable of inference for any of your desired tasks.****/
